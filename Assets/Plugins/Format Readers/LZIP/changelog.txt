verion 1.8 [Major update]

- Added support for tar/untar.
- Added support for tar.gz, tar.bz2 creation.
- Added ability to create and decompress bz2 files.
- Protection against illegal characters in zip entries.
- Faster reaction to the cancel command.
- Fixed gzip file decompression issues.
- gzip uncompress progress relies on the compressed files size now.
- tvOS uses the same functions as WebGL now, since it does not allow access to the file system.
  (WebGL sample scene renamed to reflect the above changes.)
- Combined tvOS and WebGL in one demo scene.
- Updated and refactored the demo scene and scripts to reflect the new changes.
- Removed StreamingAssets demo files. Now they will be downloaded.
- Only one glibc version of Linux plugins now provided (glibc2.17)


version 1.7.2

- Hotfix: the previous update broke the decompression of zip file. It is now fixed!
- Added 2 new functions to gzip and ungzip archives on the File System.


version 1.7.1

- Hot fix for zips that contain the __MACOSX folder.
- Added simulator plugin for iOS.

version 1.7 (Important feature and maintenance update)

- Setting level of compression to zero will now use the STORE method.
- Added the setCancel() function to cancel the compress_File, compressDir, compress_File_List, decompress_File, extract_entry, entry2Buffer functions.
- Added the ability to get byte level progress when compressing files.
- Android arm64-v8a plugin should decompress files larger then 2GB now.
- Windows: compression with unicode characters in path should work correct now.
- The getEntrySize function returns a ulong value now.
- The getFileInfo function filled Lists for uncompressed, compressed and localOffset are filled with UInt64 values now.
- The getFileInfo function fills a new list localOffset. Useful for archives with the STORE method to find the position in the zip. (you should add + 30 bytes + name.length to get the final offset)
- Demo script updated to reflect the new changes.


version 1.66

- fixed WebGL issues on Unity 2019.x
- fixed ios/tvos issue with bitcode plugins on xcode 11.x


version 1.65

- Process of decompression in bytes now returned as ulong.

version 1.63

- Using compress_File/compress_File_List/compressDir to append multiple files to a zip were very slow. Now compress_File_List and compressDir work very fast.
- For the same reason the inMemory class got some low level functions to allow much faster appending of multiple entries. See examples and docs.

- tvOS: fixed preprocessor issues on newer versions of Unity.
- iOS/tvOS: fixed potential issues with admob/facebook/google sdk.
- Windows/Android: fixed bz2 issue.
- bz2 method support for inmemory compression. (not for macos/ios/tvos/webgl.)
- plugin binary sizes got smaller.

version 1.36

Windows: A small fix to the getTotalFiles function to allow to work correctly with FileBuffers


version 1.35

All Platforms: Fixed a bug that was introduced in a previous update that had to with the outbuffer length. Now the gzip functions behave as intended.

Windows: Now you can treat a zip file that is loaded in a byte buffer as a file.

ios/gzip: updated the gzip functions.



version 1.34

Linux: fixed preprocessor directives for Unity5.4.x and up.


version 1.33

gzip: Fixed Android issues and added a 2nd ungzip function.


version 1.32

zip/Windows: better unicode support. Unity5.4 compatibility fix.

  The '__MACOSX' folder will be ignored along with files starting with '._' and files with 0 bytes size.



version 1.2

- Linux, iOS, Android, MacOSX can treat now buffers as files. That means if you have a file in www.bytes  you can perform operations directly on the buffer.
  For Android this is very useful since you can decompress from Streaming Assets without copying to  Persistent data path.

- all platforms: added support for fixed buffer operations to avoid memory allocations.
