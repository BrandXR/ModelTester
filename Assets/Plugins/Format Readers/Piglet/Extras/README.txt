To use Piglet with a Universal Render Pipeline (URP) based project, unpack the shaders from the appropriate `.unitypackage` file in this directory. For Unity versions 2019.3.0f6 through 2020.1.x, use `URP-Shaders-2019.3.unitypackage`. For Unity 2020.2.0b14 or newer, use `URP-Shaders-2020.2.unitypackage`.

The shader files will be unpacked into `Assets/Piglet/Resources/Shaders/URP`. If you to forget unpack the shaders before performing an Editor or runtime glTF import, Piglet will fail with an error reminding you to install the shaders.
